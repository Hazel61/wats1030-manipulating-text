After checking out the three text editors Nano, VI and Emacs, I have come to the conclusion that Emacs is not only the most logical to use, it is also the most powerful. Therefore, this is the text editor I will reach for in the future when creating a text file or editing a config file. I have found it essential to have the basic commmands written down and understood before starting on any of these editors. It will take a little time to make partitions in my brain for each one. What I do know is that Nano has the menu on the bottom, VI uses a colon and a letter for command, and toggles back and forth between insert and navigate, and Emacs uses control-character commands and has a simple interface. I feel I will have to understand buffers to use everything Emacs offers. The only editor I really didn't like was VI, but it gets easier with use.
